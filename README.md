# SlimeGame
A Casual Game about a slime absorbing other slimes and growing bigger
Eat other slimes to grow larger, if you run into a slime bigger than you, you'll get absorbed instead.
Slimes will chase you if they are bigger than you, or run away if they are smaller than you after they see you. Otherwise they will roam around randomly.
You start with a size of 10, Green slimes have a size of 5, the Pink Slime is fast, has a size of 10, and gives you a jump boost if you eat it, Orange slimes have a size of 25, Purple slimes have a size of 100, and the King Slime has a size of 500.
Mushrooms give the player a speed boost.
Eat the king slime to win, if you get eaten, you lose.
